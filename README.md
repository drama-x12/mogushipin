# Best Practices for PHP Code Review
1. Follow the coding standards
Establish a unified standard: Developing a consistent coding standard within the team helps improve the readability and maintainability of the code. For example, try to avoid using confusing variable names or abbreviations, and require the use of comments and documentation to ensure code readability.

Enforce with tools: Using tools like PHP_CodeSniffer or PHPMd, you can set rules to make sure everyone sticks to the same coding standards. It's more effective because it can be automated.

II. Routine Review
Comprehensive content review:

Code Style: Ensure that the code adheres to coding standards, such as using concise naming (e.g., camelCase), proper indentation and line breaks, meaningful variable names, and comments, to enhance code readability.

Error Handling: Check if there is an error handling mechanism in the code that can capture and handle exceptions in a timely manner, including handling expected and unexpected errors, providing debugging information, etc.

Security: Check for security vulnerabilities in the code, such as SQL injection, XSS attacks, etc.

Static Code Analysis: Using tools to scan code for potential errors, vulnerabilities, and non-standard code.

Logical and Functional Review: Carefully read the code to check if it implements the expected logic and functionality.

Performance Review: Evaluate the performance of the code, propose optimizations such as computational improvements and use of caching, avoid functions that have a significant impact on the application, reviewers should assess the algorithm's complexity and identify any potential bottlenecks.

Document Review: Check if the code comments are clear, accurate, and maintain a consistent documentation structure.

Collaborate with tools and team:

Code Review Tools: Utilize code review tools such as PHPStan and Psalm to automate the checking of coding standards, including syntax errors, type mismatches, and potential bugs. These tools can help identify issues that might be overlooked by manual reviewers.

Team Review: When working on a project collaboratively, team members should review each other's code and provide feedback and suggestions.

III. Adopt Automated Testing
The role of automated testing: Automated testing is a way to achieve code review. By using automated testing tools, it can quickly check for errors or vulnerabilities in applications and ensure that the program runs as required.

Using Testing Frameworks: You can use common PHP testing frameworks like PHPUnit and Codeception for testing. It is crucial to perform thorough unit tests on the function code before deployment to verify its correctness and reliability.

IV. Regular Review
Determine the Review Cycle: It is recommended to conduct code reviews at the end of each development iteration cycle. Regular code reviews allow for early identification and resolution of issues.
